        In modern music, many compositions are polymodal. Now many
        contemporary compositions are not easily written by the traditional
        notation system.  In order to obtain better understanding for
        polymodality, let’s extend the traditional diatonic solfège into
        chromatic solfège. 
        
        This article will explain how to implement new chromatic solfège by
        introducing additional note names, and then it will show how to
        build fluency with the new solfege system by mechanically
        enumerating all possible intervals.

        Not only does this article provide written materials, it also
        provides audible materials. Every examples in this article
        including explanations and notes can be listen.  It takes
        approximately one hour to listen through the whole article.

c.t_header0`Introduction`;
c.t_textBody`
        In the modern diatonic based interval system, there are certain missing
        intervals which do not exist without irregular accidentals such as
        double flat, double sharp, C\cflat , F\cflat. E\csharp and B\csharp.
        For example G\cflat does not have the perfect 4th interval without an
        irregular flatted note C\cflat.  Enharmonically speaking, C\cflat is
        B\cnatural; but harmonically speaking, B\cnatural from G\cflat is the
        augmented major 3rd rather than the perfect 4th. 

        In modern music, most tunes are played in equal temperament. Especially
        in jazz music in 1980’s or later, the scales are premised equal
        temperament and players frequently modulate tonality of tunes. However,
        the music notation is still using the diatonic based interval system;
        therefore it is still necessary to go through the complication of the
        missing intervals.

        In general, it is preferable to write intervals with harmonically
        correct name; for example, writing G\cflat major scale’s 4th note as
        C\cflat rather than B\cnatural is preferable because B\cnatural is not
        4th but augmented major 3rd. In practical use, however, harmonic
        correctness is often intentionally disregarded because it does not
        employ how to play on musical instruments; therefore it is also very
        common to write C\cflat as B\cnatural in this case. The modern musical
        instruments are based on equal temperament; in spite of the note that a
        player should play is harmonically C\cflat, the player has to
        manipulate their instrument as if the note is B\cnatural.

        There are many inconsistently written notes in practical world. In
        order to obtain better and faster reading ability, let’s name all
        the intervals chromatically, and then enumerate all the possible
        irregular intervals, and we categorize them into three classes, and
        train ourselves to build fluency to the irregularity.

c.t_header1`Diatonic-Based Notation System`;
c.t_textBody`
    Modern European music notation is based on a diatonic scale; that is,
    it presumes that there are seven notes in an octave. In practical world,
    scales are not always diatonic. For example, rock music is often based on a
    pentatonic scale which consists five notes in an octave. Jazz music
    often uses intervals which are based on the diminished scale which
    consists eight notes in an octave. 

    In a diatonic scale, if third intervals are stacked repeatedly, the
    entire note group spans two octaves as \textit{ [ do mi sol ti re fa la do]}. 
    \\~

c.writeScore( 'example01', `@do do mi sol ti re fa la do`, { texGraphicWidth : 0.6 , lyTextAfter : [5,3]} );
        
c.t_textBody`
    \\~
    \\~

    This property is also inherited to the notation system.  Therefore,
    when it comes to write intervals which are not based on a diatonic
    based scale, it will be problematic.  

    For example, the diminished scale is an octatonic scale.  The
    diminished scale is a compound of two diminished 7th chords. The
    diminished 7th chord consists four notes; thus the diminished scale
    consists eight notes. The four notes which belong to diminished 7th
    chord are considered that the intervals between the notes are always
    minor 3rd.  As mentioned above, repeatedly stacking third intervals in
    diatonic scale spans two octaves; but in octatonic scales, stacking 3rd
    intervals spans only an octave. There is a gap between two.

c.writeScore( 'example01', `@do do me se la`,   { texGraphicWidth : 0.6 , lyTextAfter : [5,3]} );

    \\~
    \\~

    Interval between G\cflat and A is not minor third, but augmented
    second. In order to follow the harmonic correctness, this interval
    should be written as G\cflat and B\cdoubleflat.

    The modern European music notation system always yields such "gaps"
    when it is used for writing intervals which are based on non-diatonic
    scale. Such gaps become "wrinkles" on the notation system and one will
    see them as irregular accidentals such as double-sharp, double-flat,
    triple-sharp, triple-flat.

    Diminished fifth and augmented fourth are enharmonically equivalent.
    Diminished fifth is an interval which consists six semitones. And so is
    augmented fourth; it is an interval which consists same six semitones. 

    But those two have different functions and are used in different
    context. Diminished fifth has a function to provoke listeners want to
    hear smaller intervals such as major third at the next.

    \\~

c.writeScore( 'example01', `@do do4 re mi fa sol la ti do || ti,4 fa' do mi `, { texGraphicWidth : 0.6 , lyTextAfter : [5,3], scmFestivalTempo:150} );
c.t_textBody`
    \\~
    \\~

    But augmented fourth does not has such a function; it will stay in the
    same intervals.

c.writeScore( 'example01', `@do fa4 sol la ti do re mi fa || fa,4 ti fa ti`, { texGraphicWidth : 0.6 , lyTextAfter : [5,3], scmFestivalTempo:150 } );


// c.t_textBody`
//         \csharp 9th is another example.
//         Intervals ri fa are not major 2nd but diminished 3rd. In order to
//         keep consistency of intervals, it is considered more consistent to
//         write ri fa as ri ma or me fa. In the same manner, li do may be
//         written as li ta or te do.

    Therefore, any notation system should be able to distinctly show these
    functional difference. 
    
    But many musical instrumental players often do not prefer to follow the
    interval correctness.  Because most instruments are not based on
    intervals but absolute note name. For example, a piano has keys which
    are corresponding to musical notes and those are supposed to be pushed
    in order to obtain the actual notes.  In such instruments, interval
    correctness does not employ how to play it.

    At this point, guitars are different. Rarely are guitarists aware what
    note they are actually playing. In most of time, the only thing what
    guitarists care is what "intervals" they are playing. 

    On guitars, musical intervals are always appearing as the same
    configuration no matter what key the notes are belong to.  The
    configuration of musical notes on a fretboard of a guitar is
    enharmonically normalized and consistently aligned. Unlike piano, there
    are no duplicated notes which comes from note alternation.  
    
    The following pictures depict Cmaj7, D\cflat maj7 Dmaj7 E\cflat maj7 on
    a fretboard of a guitar. One can see in the pictures that how the
    tetrad consistently moves to right as they are transposed to higher
    keys.

    Therefore, intervals are the first thing to come into minds of 
    guitarists and rarely do guitarists aware what notes they are playing.
    Pianists tent to respell notes with irregular accidentals into
    enharmonic equivalent notes. But Enharmonically respelled musical notes
    do not make much sense for guitarists because they do not employ how to play
    on guitars. Rather, guitarists prefer harmonically consistent note
    spelling as following :

    In this way of spelling notes, one can easily see that the tetrad is
    consistently transposed with a half step each with the drawback that
    one cannot easily tell what notes they actually belong to. This way of
    spelling notes eases guitarists to read musical notes; in the mean
    time, this might be harsh to other majority of musicians.
    
    Unfortunately for the guitarists, the majority of musicians prefers
    enharmonic spelling. This is also a major reason why many guitarists
    are not able to read musical notes.

    Comparing harmonic spelling and enharmonic spelling, both have their
    advantages and disadvantages.  Enharmonic spelling denotes how to play
    instruments but one cannot tell how it sounds because of harmonic
    incorrectness. Harmonic spelling, though, denotes how it sounds;
    therefore it helps one to understand the patterns laying underneath the
    music. But it often confuses instrumental players.

    They oppose to each other and it seems that there is no way to satisfy
    the both requirement.

c.t_header1`A Probable Solution to Satisfy Both Harmonic Correctness and Enharmonic Correctness`;
c.t_textBody`
    This thesis is introducing a method to satisfy both harmonic
    correctness and enharmonic correctness without modifying the rule of
    the traditional musical notation system; the method is invented by
    Atsushi Oka.

    The idea is, extending traditional solfege ( [do re mi] ) into
    chromatic to name all of semitones in the diatonic scale, and
    memorizing the every association between harmonically spelled intervals
    enharmonically spelled intervals, and enumerating every corner cases
    which can occur in the traditional musical notation system, and
    memorizing all of them to understand the reason of the complication.

    This paper includes comprehensively studied list of every intervals.
    Every examples slightly differ with each other. The one watching it
    will see the reason why it need to be written with irregular
    accidentals as if it is in a flipbook.
